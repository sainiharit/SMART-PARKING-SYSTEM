# SMART-PARKING-SYSTEM

Parking Queues have been a long problem in metropolitan cities. Parking Queues involve the following problems: 
1) Time wasted at parking registration and payment. 
2) People tend to forget the parking location on traversing back. 
3) When un-parking, the payment desk involves queues. 
4) Random parking involves traffic and confusion inside parking. 
5) Pollution emission, as the population increases, this makes a considerable number.

What we want is to enable the user to park the car at the slot, un-park it, and go to his destination without any brakes!
